# intrinsic-value


Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock or ETF using the (adjusted) Benjamin Graham formula, which is:

V = (EPS * (8.5 + 2g) * AAA)/Y 

Where:
V = the value expected from the growth formulas over the next 5 years

EPS = the companyâ€™s last 12-month earnings per share

7 = P/E base for a no-growth company

g = reasonably expected 5 year growth rate

AAA = the average yield of AAA corporate bonds in 1962 (Graham did not specify the duration of the bonds, though it has been asserted that he used 20 year AAA bonds as his benchmark for this variable)

Y = the current yield on AAA corporate bonds.
